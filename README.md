# E-Learning Site

This is the frontend for an E-learning site developed during my internship at Devsinz. The project was built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, providing a fast and responsive user experience for online learners. I also used Context API in this project to propogate changes in edit profile to main profile page.
